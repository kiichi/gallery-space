## Translation

1. Uncomment line 10 translateLiteral() in functions.js . Actual translation is in custom.js
2. See console, HTML dump in the middle
3. Save it as ja.html
4. See original index.html's photo section. Migrate <section> manually because it runed before loading

TODO: fix meta tag translation and above bug
Take Picutres
